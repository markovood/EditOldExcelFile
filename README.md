# EditOldExcelFile
Here I just practice using third party libraries in a random project.
I have downloaded the catalogue of colors (in an excel file - 'imagine.xls') of a popular company and modified it by getting the RGB color codes from the table and setting the background color of the row to it.
The result is a nice colorful real excel table visualizing the color RGB and HEX codes, color name and the color itself.
